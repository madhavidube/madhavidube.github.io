                <p>Skills are an important aspect of a person's career as they define your ability in your domain. In my opinion, with skills and knowledge, socializing is also an important aspect. Throughout my academic career, I have joined a lot of clubs and organizations for improving my self-confidence, public speaking, and networking. I have also worked as Student Assistant at my university to provide assistance to all the freshers with their on-boarding process and practicals. I strongly believe technical as well as non-technical knowledge are important when it comes to thriving in society. Here are a few of my skills and the activities that I have recently undertook.</p>
